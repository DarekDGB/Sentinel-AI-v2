1. Introduction
The next decade introduces threats such as rented hashrate farms, industrial-scale 51% attacks, AI-driven fraud, mempool automation, and quantum computing. DigiByte requires an adaptive security layer. Sentinel AI v2 is the intelligence engine in the 3-layer defensive stack: DQSN → Sentinel AI v2 → ADN.

2. Role in the 3-Layer System
DQSN provides entropy, timing, and chain anomaly telemetry.
Sentinel AI v2 converts telemetry into intelligence: risk scoring, attack prediction, quantum anomaly alerts, mempool manipulation detection.
ADN executes defensive responses: hardened mode, PQC activation, peer filtering, emergency fee logic.

3. Threat Model
Sentinel v2 detects:
Classical attacks: 51%, deep reorg, time-warp, double-spend, spam floods.
Network manipulation: Sybil clustering, eclipse isolation, regional partitioning.
Adversarial ML attacks: model poisoning, synthetic “normal” behaviour, masked anomalies, drift suppression.
Quantum attacks: Grover-based key search, Shor-based ECDSA factorization, draining weak keys.

4. Design Philosophy
Offline-trained, online-evaluated to avoid poisoning.
Hybrid adversarial resistance using AI plus deterministic logic.
Deterministic safety rails: entropy + mempool + reorg spike forces CRITICAL.
Cryptographic integrity: verified model hashes and signatures.
Modular and fully auditable structure.

5. System Components
Offline AI model trained on DQSN data, synthetic quantum scenarios, adversarial datasets, and historical attacks.
Adversarial Engine detects overly-stable patterns, suppressed variance, borderline behaviour, poisoning, drift attacks.
Correlation Engine cross-analyzes entropy, mempool, reorg, peers, timestamps, hashrate.
Circuit Breakers enforce non-bypassable kill switches.

6. Circuit Breakers
Circuit Breaker A: triggers when entropy_drop, mempool_anomaly, and reorg_depth exceed thresholds. Forces CRITICAL, activates hardened mode, enforces PQC, neutralizes attack.
Circuit Breaker B: triggered by timestamp manipulation, synchronized multi-region anomalies, repeated sudden reorgs.

7. Scoring Pipeline
Four stages: correlation, adversarial analysis, circuit breakers, final scoring.
Status mapping: CRITICAL if any circuit breaker triggers; HIGH if score ≥ 0.8; ELEVATED if ≥ 0.4; NORMAL otherwise.
Output format: status, risk_score, and details.

8. Public API
Developers call SentinelClient to evaluate telemetry snapshots.
Example: result = client.evaluate_snapshot(raw_telemetry)
Returned structure: status, risk_score, and details describing signals that caused the classification.

9. Security and Licensing
No model weights included (MIT-compliant).
No ML runtime dependency.
No consensus rule modifications.
No private key interaction.
Very low licensing and legal risk.

10. Future Extensions
Roadmap includes graph neural networks, temporal anomaly networks, swarm-based cross-node detection, PQC anomaly classifiers, encrypted on-chain telemetry, and wallet-signalling behavioural analytics.
